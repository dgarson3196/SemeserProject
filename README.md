## Description

Semester project Mobile app for CIS 298.
The purpose of this app is to create a app similar to that of the UBER app.
This app will allow the user to select to be either the Driver or the Rider.
After which you will be able to pickup rides or ask for rides depending on the 
path you decide to take.

### Notes
Because the login information is handled through a database if the server blocks 
access to an external database you may have problems.
